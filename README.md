* Array Identifier:

### Testing Tasks

- [ ] LRS, HRS
- [ ] RESET/SET: single pulse with different voltages

## SNet Algorithm Demo

* Baseline configuration:
	* 0-2, three categories input
	* input neurons: 121
	* output neurons: 8
	* init states: `w_min`
* Baseline performance:
	* ~ 95%

### STDP

#### Mechanism

* The classical ideal STDP works in an exponentially continuous manner. 
* Should be quantized into certain levels for hardware implementations.
* During the update process, the weight delta `dw = |w(t) - w_bound| * mu * alpha`, where 
	* `mu` is the learning factor, is a fixed constant.
	* Original software algorithm uses discrete timesteps, thus drop factor `alpha = exp(-dt/tau)` is discrete numbers.
	* `|w(t) - w_bound|` is relevant to the current state of the synapse, and is a continuous value.
	* Therefore, `dw` is continuous and relevant to the current state of the synapse.
* It would be much more convenient for hardware implementation if `dw` is discrete and irrelevant to the synapse state.

### Software Porting

#### `|w(t) - w_bound|` to `w_max - w_min`

- [ ] Performance drop:

#### Reduce time difference interest window

- [ ] Reduce to `n` timesteps:
